## Purpose

Aligning with IT strategy:
- Ensures technical decisions support long-term goals
- Avoids creating technical debt
- Enables integration with existing systems
- Supports enterprise architecture standards
- Maximises return on technology investment

| **Architecture fit** | Does the solution align with enterprise architecture? |
| **Technology standards** | Are approved technologies being used? |
| **Integration** | How does it connect with existing systems? |
| **Data** | How does it align with data strategy? |
| **Security** | Does it meet security requirements? |
| **Cloud strategy** | Does it align with cloud adoption plans? |
