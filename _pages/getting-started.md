# Getting Started with Project Management

Welcome! Whether you're new to project management or looking to formalise your skills, this guide will help you understand the fundamentals and find the resources you need.

---

## What is Project Management?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.
</div>

A **project** is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. Unlike ongoing operations, projects have:
- A defined **start** and **end**
- Specific **objectives** to achieve
- **Constraints** (time, cost, scope, quality)
- A **temporary team** assembled for the purpose

---

## The Project Manager Role

As a project manager, you're responsible for:

| Responsibility | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Planning** | Defining what needs to be done, when, and by whom |
| **Organising** | Assembling resources and structuring work |
| **Leading** | Motivating and directing the team |
| **Controlling** | Monitoring progress and managing changes |
| **Communicating** | Keeping stakeholders informed |

## The Project Lifecycle

Every project follows a lifecycle from start to finish:

<div class="mermaid">

    A[Startup] --> B[Initiation]
    B --> C[Planning]
    C --> D[Delivery]
    D --> E[Closure]

    classDef blue fill:#108BB9,stroke:none,color:#fff
    class A,B,C,D,E blue
</div>

| Stage | Purpose | Key Activities |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Startup** | Confirm viability | Create mandate, outline business case |
| **Initiation** | Define the project | Write charter/PID, identify stakeholders |
| **Planning** | Plan the work | Create schedules, budgets, plans |
| **Delivery** | Do the work | Build, test, manage changes |
| **Closure** | Wrap up | Handover, lessons learned, close |

## Essential Concepts

### The Triple Constraint

Every project balances three constraints:

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    S[Scope] --- T[Time]
    T --- C[Cost]
    C --- S
    S --- Q((Quality))
    T --- Q
    C --- Q

    classDef blue fill:#108BB9,stroke:none,color:#fff
    class S,T,C,Q blue
</div>

- **Scope** - What will be delivered
- **Time** - When it will be delivered
- **Cost** - What resources are needed
- **Quality** - How good it needs to be

Changing one affects the others. Your job is to balance them.

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are anyone who affects, is affected by, or perceives themselves affected by your project:
- **Sponsor** - Provides funding and authority
- **Customer/Users** - Will use the deliverables
- **Team** - Does the work
- **Suppliers** - Provide goods or services
- **Others** - Regulators, affected departments, etc.

**Learn more:** [Identify Stakeholders](/projects/identify_stakeholders)

### Requirements

Requirements define what the project must deliver:
- **Business requirements** - Why the project exists
- **Stakeholder requirements** - What users need
- **Functional requirements** - What the solution must do
- **Non-functional requirements** - How well it must perform

**Learn more:** [Requirements](/projects/requirements)

### Risk Management

Risks are uncertain events that could affect your project. Managing them involves:
1. **Identifying** potential risks
2. **Assessing** probability and impact
3. **Planning** responses
4. **Monitoring** throughout the project

**Learn more:** [Risk Management](/risk-management/)
