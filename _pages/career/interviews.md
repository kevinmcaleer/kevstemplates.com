## The STAR Method

Use STAR to structure behavioural answers:

<div class="mermaid">

    S[Situation] --> T[Task]
    T --> A[Action]
    A --> R[Result]

    classDef blue fill:#108BB9,stroke:none,color:#fff
    class S,T,A,R blue
</div>

| Element | Content | Time |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Situation** | Set the context briefly | 15% |
| **Task** | What was your responsibility | 10% |
| **Action** | What YOU specifically did | 50% |
| **Result** | Outcome, what you learned | 25% |

### STAR Example

**Question**: "Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult stakeholder."

**Answer**:
- **Situation**: "On a CRM implementation, the Sales Director was resistant to the new system and was spreading negativity to his team."
- **Task**: "As PM, I needed to turn him from blocker to champion to ensure adoption."
- **Action**: "I scheduled one-on-one meetings to understand his concerns. I discovered he worried about data security and losing his pipeline visibility. I addressed each concern specifically, gave him early access to demos, and involved him in key design decisions."
- **Result**: "He became the project's strongest advocate, presenting at the go-live meeting. User adoption in sales was 95% within the first month."

## Common Interview Questions

### General/Opening Questions

#### "Tell me about yourself"

**Strategy**: 2-minute PM career summary focusing on relevance.

**Structure**:
1. Current role and key achievements (30 sec)
2. Relevant experience and progression (60 sec)
3. Why this role interests you (30 sec)

**Example**:
> "I'm currently a Senior PM at TechCorp where I've delivered a £2M digital transformation programme. Over the past 7 years, I've progressed from coordinator to leading complex projects across IT and operations. I'm drawn to this role because it combines my programme management experience with my interest in your industry..."

---

#### "Why do you want this role?"

**Strategy**: Connect your goals to their needs.

**Good answer includes**:
- Research about their organisation
- Alignment with your career goals
- What you can contribute
- Genuine enthusiasm

**Avoid**: Generic answers, focusing only on salary/benefits

---

### Behavioural Questions

#### "Tell me about a project that failed or had significant problems"

**Strategy**: Show self-awareness and learning.

**Key points**:
- Own your part (don't blame others)
- Explain what you learned
- Describe how you've applied that learning since

**Example**:
> "We launched a new product on an aggressive timeline. I accepted the deadline without pushing back enough on feasibility. The launch had quality issues. I learned to be more assertive about realistic timelines and now always present options rather than just accepting constraints. On my next project, I negotiated a phased launch approach."

---

#### "Describe a time you managed conflicting stakeholder demands"

**Strategy**: Show stakeholder management skills.

**Key points**:
- Identify the conflict clearly
- Explain your approach to resolution
- Focus on finding common ground
- Describe the outcome

---

#### "Tell me about a time you delivered under pressure"

**Strategy**: Show resilience and problem-solving.

**Key points**:
- Describe the pressure honestly
- Focus on your specific actions
- Explain how you managed stress
- Quantify the positive outcome

---

#### "Give an example of how you motivated an underperforming team"

**Strategy**: Show leadership without authority.

**Key points**:
- Understand the root cause first
- Use positive approaches
- Focus on support, not blame
- Describe measurable improvement

---

### Situational Questions

#### "What would you do if your project was running behind schedule?"

**Strategy**: Show structured problem-solving.

**Framework**:
1. Assess the situation (how far behind, what's impacted)
2. Identify root causes
3. Develop options (crashing, fast-tracking, scope adjustment)
4. Consult stakeholders on trade-offs
5. Implement and monitor

**Example**:
> "First, I'd analyse why we're behind - is it resource issues, scope creep, or dependencies? Then I'd quantify the delay and impact. I'd develop options: can we add resources, work in parallel, or reduce scope? I'd present these to the sponsor with recommendations, get a decision, and update the plan accordingly."

---

#### "How would you handle a sponsor who keeps changing requirements?"

**Strategy**: Show change control and stakeholder skills.

**Key points**:
- Acknowledge their needs
- Explain the impact of changes
- Implement change control
- Offer structured alternatives

---

#### "What would you do if a team member wasn't delivering?"

**Strategy**: Show people management skills.

**Framework**:
1. Have a private conversation
2. Understand any blockers
3. Set clear expectations
4. Provide support
5. Escalate if needed

---

### Technical Questions

#### "Explain the project lifecycle"

**Answer structure**:
- Name the phases (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, Closure)
- Brief description of each
- Key deliverables
- Relate to their context if possible

---

#### "What is the critical path?"

**Answer**:
> "The critical path is the longest sequence of dependent activities that determines the minimum project duration. Activities on the critical path have zero float - any delay directly delays the project. I identify it using forward and backward pass calculations through the network diagram."

---

#### "What's the difference between risk and issue?"

**Answer**:
> "A risk is an uncertain future event that may or may not happen. An issue is a problem that has already occurred. Risks are managed proactively through mitigation plans. Issues require immediate resolution. A risk that occurs becomes an issue."

---

#### "How do you calculate Earned Value?"

**Answer**:
> "Earned Value measures work completed against the plan. Key formulas:
> - EV = % Complete × Budget at Completion
> - CPI = EV ÷ AC (cost efficiency)
> - SPI = EV ÷ PV (schedule efficiency)
> - Values above 1 are good - you're under budget or ahead of schedule."

---

#### "Explain PRINCE2 / Agile / PMP methodology"

**Strategy**: Show practical understanding, not just textbook knowledge.

**PRINCE2 answer**:
> "PRINCE2 is built on 7 principles, 7 themes, and 7 processes. What I find most valuable is the continued business justification - regularly checking the project still makes sense - and managing by exception, which empowers PMs within defined tolerances."

**Agile answer**:
> "Agile prioritises delivering value iteratively, embracing change, and collaborating with customers. In Scrum, we work in sprints, hold daily standups, and continuously improve through retrospectives. The key shift from Waterfall is accepting that requirements evolve."

---

### Questions About Specific Scenarios

#### "How do you estimate a project?"

**Answer structure**:
- Mention multiple techniques (analogous, parametric, three-point, Planning Poker)
- Explain your process (breakdown, involve team, add contingency)
- Acknowledge uncertainty (ranges, confidence levels)
- Mention re-estimation as you learn more

---

#### "How do you manage stakeholders?"

**Answer structure**:
- Identify and analyse (power/interest grid)
- Plan engagement approach for each
- Communicate appropriately
- Monitor and adapt
- Give a specific example

---

#### "How do you handle scope creep?"

**Answer**:
> "Prevention through clear scope definition and sign-off upfront. Detection through regular scope reviews. Management through formal change control - every request is documented, impact assessed, and decided by appropriate authority. I've found that saying 'yes, and here's the impact' is more effective than just saying no."
