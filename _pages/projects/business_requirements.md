# Business Requirements

Business requirements describe what the organisation needs to achieve its goals, independent of any specific solution.

## What are Business Requirements?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> Business requirements are high-level statements of the goals, objectives, and needs of the organisation that a project must address.
</div>

Business requirements describe the **what** and **why**, not the **how**.

## Types of Requirements

| **Business** | Organisational goals | "Reduce order processing time by 50%" |
| **Stakeholder** | User needs | "Sales team needs mobile access" |
| **Functional** | System behaviour | "System shall calculate tax automatically" |
| **Non-functional** | Quality attributes | "System must be available 99.9%" |
