# Project Charter

The Project Charter is the foundational document that formally authorises a project to exist and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organisational resources to project activities.

---

## What is a Project Charter?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> A Project Charter is a formal document that authorises a project, defines its objectives and scope at a high level, identifies key stakeholders, and grants the project manager authority to proceed.
</div>

---

## Purpose

The Project Charter serves to:
- **Authorise** the project formally
- **Define** high-level objectives and scope
- **Identify** the project manager and sponsor
- **Establish** authority to apply resources
- **Create** a shared understanding among stakeholders

## When is it Created?

    D --> E[Detailed<br/>Planning]

The Charter is typically created during the **initiation phase**, after the business need has been identified but before detailed planning begins.

## Charter vs Other Documents

| Document | Purpose | When Created |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Project Mandate** | Initial idea, trigger for project | Pre-project |
| **Project Charter** | Formal authorisation | Initiation |
| **Project Brief** | Detailed justification | Initiation |
| **PID** | Full project definition | End of initiation |

## Key Components

A Project Charter typically includes:

### Essential Elements

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Project Title** | Clear, descriptive name |
| **Project Purpose** | Why is this project needed? |
| **Objectives** | What will the project achieve? |
| **Scope Statement** | High-level boundaries |
| **Key Deliverables** | Major outputs |
| **Success Criteria** | How success will be measured |
| **Project Manager** | Named individual with authority |
| **Project Sponsor** | Executive accountable for project |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Supporting Elements

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Key Stakeholders** | Main parties involved |
| **High-level Timeline** | Key milestones and dates |
| **Budget Estimate** | Order of magnitude cost |
| **Key Assumptions** | Conditions assumed to be true |

| **Key Risks** | Major uncertainties |
| **Approval Signatures** | Sign-off from sponsor |

## Writing Effective Objectives

Use SMART criteria for project objectives:

| Criterion | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Specific** | Clear and precise | "Implement new CRM system" |
| **Measurable** | Quantifiable | "Reduce processing time by 30%" |
| **Achievable** | Realistic | Within team capabilities |
| **Relevant** | Aligned to business need | Supports sales growth strategy |
| **Time-bound** | Has deadline | "Complete by Q3 2026" |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

## Scope Statement Tips

The scope statement should be:
- **High-level** - Not detailed requirements
- **Bounded** - Clear what's in and out
- **Agreed** - Stakeholders aligned
- **Flexible** - Allows for refinement later

### In Scope / Out of Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| What the project WILL deliver | What the project will NOT deliver |
| Boundaries of work | Exclusions and limitations |
| Included locations/teams | Excluded locations/teams |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## Authority Granted

The Charter grants the Project Manager authority to:
- Allocate assigned resources
- Make day-to-day decisions
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Escalate issues to sponsor
- Spend within approved budget

---

## Approval Process

<div class="mermaid">

    A[Draft<br/>Charter] --> B[Review with<br/>Stakeholders]
    B --> C[Refine<br/>Content]
    C --> D[Sponsor<br/>Approval]
    D --> E[Charter<br/>Issued]

    classDef blue fill:#108BB9,stroke:none,color:#fff
    class A,B,C,D,E blue
</div>

The Charter should be:
1. **Drafted** by the project manager
2. **Reviewed** with key stakeholders
3. **Refined** based on feedback
4. **Approved** by the project sponsor
5. **Distributed** to stakeholders

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Avoidance |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Too much detail | Becomes a plan, not authorisation | Keep high-level |
| No clear authority | PM lacks mandate | Explicitly state authority |
| Vague objectives | No clear success criteria | Use SMART objectives |
| Missing sponsor | No executive backing | Identify sponsor early |
| Not signed | No formal commitment | Get signatures |
