- Discussions with the Project Board and users if the project mandate is incomplete or if no project mandate is provided
- Discussions with the operations and maintenance organisation (if applicable)
- Discussions with the (potential) suppliers regarding specialist development lifecycles that could be used
- Lessons Log
