## Facilitation Techniques

### Appreciative Inquiry
Focus on what went well:
- **Discover** - What worked?
- **Dream** - What could be?
- **Design** - What should be?
- **Deliver** - How do we implement?

### Start/Stop/Continue
- **Start** - What should we begin doing?
- **Stop** - What should we stop doing?
- **Continue** - What should we keep doing?

### Timeline Review
Walk through the project chronologically, identifying key moments and lessons at each stage.

### Mad/Sad/Glad
Emotional reflection on the project:
- **Mad** - What frustrated you?
- **Sad** - What disappointed you?
- **Glad** - What made you happy?

### 4Ls Retrospective
- **Liked** - What did you enjoy?
- **Learned** - What did you learn?
- **Lacked** - What was missing?
- **Longed for** - What did you wish for?

### Sailboat Retrospective

    D[Rocks<br/>What risks?] --> B
    B --> E[Island<br/>Our Goals]

    classDef blue fill:#108BB9,stroke:none,color:#fff
    class A,B,C,D,E blue
</div>

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Wind** | What pushed us forward? |
| **Anchor** | What held us back? |
| **Rocks** | What risks did we navigate? |
| **Island** | Did we reach our destination? |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Five Whys
Drill down to root causes:
1. Why did this happen? → Answer 1
2. Why did that happen? → Answer 2
3. Why? → Answer 3
4. Why? → Answer 4
5. Why? → Root cause identified

## Workshop Facilitation Guide

### Workshop Planning

| Element | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Timing** | 2-4 hours depending on project size |
| **Location** | Neutral, comfortable space |
| **Attendees** | All team members, key stakeholders |
| **Facilitation** | Neutral party, not the PM |
| **Materials** | Sticky notes, markers, flip charts |
| **Pre-work** | Optional survey to gather initial thoughts |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Choosing the Right Facilitator

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **External facilitator** | Neutral, experienced | Cost, availability |
| **PMO colleague** | Knows methodology | May lack independence |
| **Peer PM** | Understands context | May be too close |
| **Team lead** | Knows details | May inhibit openness |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Best Practice:</strong> The Project Manager should not facilitate their own lessons learned session. They should participate as a contributor, allowing others to share openly.

### Setting Ground Rules

Establish these at the start of every session:

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Vegas rule** | What's said here stays here |
| **No blame** | Focus on improvement, not fault |
| **All perspectives valid** | Everyone's experience matters |
| **One voice** | No interrupting, let people finish |
| **Phones away** | Full attention on discussion |
| **Specific examples** | Concrete, not vague generalisations |
| **Action focus** | Turn insights into improvements |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Facilitator Script

**Opening:**
> "Thank you for joining this lessons learned session. Our goal is to capture what we've learned from [Project Name] so we can improve future projects. This is not about blame or finding fault - it's about honest reflection and continuous improvement. What's shared here stays within this group unless we agree to share it more widely."

**Transition to challenges:**
> "We've had a great discussion about what went well. Now let's shift to areas for improvement. Remember, this isn't about criticising individuals - it's about identifying how we can do better as an organisation. What would you do differently if starting this project again?"

**Closing:**
> "Thank you for your honest contributions today. We've identified [X] key lessons and [Y] actions. [Name] will circulate the lessons report within [timeframe]. These insights will be added to our knowledge base and shared with [relevant teams]."

### Handling Difficult Situations

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Blame game** | Redirect: "Let's focus on what we can change for next time" |
| **One person dominates** | "Thank you. Let's hear from others. [Name], what's your perspective?" |
| **Nobody talks** | Use round-robin: "Let's go around the room. [Name], start us off" |
| **Gets too detailed** | "Let's capture that specific example and continue with broader themes" |
| **Becomes emotional** | Acknowledge: "This clearly matters. Let's take a brief pause" |
| **Conflict emerges** | "Both perspectives are valid. Let's note both and move on" |
| **Strays off topic** | "Interesting point. Let's park that and stay focused on our lessons" |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Managing Sensitive Topics

<div class="mermaid">

</div>

**Tips for sensitive discussions:**
- Don't dismiss genuine concerns
- Avoid naming individuals in documented lessons
- Focus on systemic issues, not personal failures
- Offer to discuss privately if needed
- Ensure psychological safety

### Virtual Facilitation

Running lessons learned sessions remotely:

#### Tools and Setup

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Video conferencing** | Primary discussion (Zoom, Teams, Meet) |
| **Digital whiteboard** | Collaborative capture (Miro, Mural, Jamboard) |
| **Polling** | Anonymous input, prioritisation (Mentimeter, Slido) |
| **Document** | Real-time notes (shared Google Doc, OneNote) |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

#### Virtual Session Adaptations

| In-Person | Virtual Equivalent |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Sticky notes on wall | Virtual sticky notes |
| Dot voting | Poll or reaction buttons |
| Breakout discussions | Breakout rooms |
| Reading body language | Camera-on policy, check-ins |
| Energy management | Shorter sessions, more breaks |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

#### Virtual Facilitation Tips

- **Shorter sessions** - 90 minutes max, then break
- **Camera on** - Encourage visibility for engagement
- **Active facilitation** - Call on people by name
- **Use chat** - Alternative for quieter participants
- **Anonymous input** - Polls for sensitive topics
- **Record with consent** - For those who can't attend
- **Clear instructions** - Step-by-step for tools

---

## Lesson Template

For each lesson captured:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Title** | Brief description |
| **Category** | Type of lesson |
| **Context** | What was the situation? |
| **Event** | What happened? |
| **Impact** | What was the effect? |
| **Root cause** | Why did it happen? |
| **Recommendation** | What should be done differently? |
| **Owner** | Who will action this? |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## Common Lessons Topics

| Area | Common Lessons |
|------|----------------|
| **Estimation** | Tasks took longer than expected |
| **Requirements** | Scope wasn't clear enough |
| **Stakeholders** | Engagement should have started earlier |
| **Testing** | More time needed for UAT |
| **Communication** | Status updates could be clearer |
| **Risk** | Risks weren't escalated soon enough |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## Making Lessons Stick

Lessons are only valuable if they're applied:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Embed in templates** | Update standard documents |
| **Update processes** | Revise procedures |
| **Training** | Include in onboarding |
| **Checklists** | Add to quality gates |
| **Knowledge base** | Store in searchable repository |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## Sample Lessons

### Well-Written Lesson Example

```
LESSON: Requirements sign-off process

Category: Planning

Context: The project had multiple stakeholder groups
with different requirements priorities.

Event: Requirements were gathered but not formally
signed off before development began. Two weeks into
development, a key stakeholder raised significant
changes.

Impact: 3-week delay and £15,000 rework costs.
Team frustration and credibility impact.

Root Cause: No formal sign-off gate existed.
Assumed verbal agreement was sufficient.

Recommendation: Implement mandatory requirements
sign-off gate with documented approval from all
stakeholder groups before development commences.
Use a RACI matrix to define approval authorities.

Owner: PMO to update project template
Due Date: End of month
```

### Poorly-Written Lesson (Anti-Pattern)

```
BAD: "Communication could have been better"

Why it's poor:
- Too vague - what aspect of communication?
- No context or specific example
- No root cause analysis
- No actionable recommendation
- No owner assigned

BETTER: "Daily stand-ups missed key stakeholders.
Add business representative to daily stand-ups
for projects with significant business change."
```

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Process Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Skipping lessons learned** | "No time" - miss learning opportunity | Schedule in project plan from day 1 |
| **Only at project end** | Wait too long, details forgotten | Conduct at each stage/milestone |
| **Only capturing negatives** | Demoralising, miss what works | Balance positives and improvements |
| **PM facilitates own session** | Team won't share openly | Use neutral facilitator |
| **No pre-work** | Workshop time wasted on recall | Send survey beforehand |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Documentation Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Naming individuals** | Blame culture, legal risk | Focus on process, not people |
| **Vague lessons** | Can't be acted upon | Require specific examples |
| **No root cause** | Treats symptoms | Use Five Whys technique |
| **No owner/action** | Nothing changes | Assign accountability |
| **Filed and forgotten** | No improvement happens | Active follow-up process |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Facilitation Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Senior person dominates** | Others won't contradict | Anonymous input, silent brainstorm first |
| **Jumping to solutions** | Premature closure | Separate identify → analyse → solve |
| **Too ambitious** | Try to fix everything | Prioritise top 5 lessons |
| **No psychological safety** | Surface issues only | Establish ground rules, model vulnerability |
| **All talk, no action** | Cynicism for next time | Assign owners, track to completion |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}
