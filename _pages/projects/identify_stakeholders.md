# Stakeholder Management

Effective stakeholder management is critical to project success. This guide covers how to identify, analyse, and engage stakeholders throughout your project.

## What is a Stakeholder?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> A stakeholder is anyone who affects, is affected by, or perceives themselves to be affected by a project or its outcome.
</div>

Stakeholders include:
- Those with **authority** over the project (sponsors, governance)
- Those with **interest** in outcomes (users, customers)
- Those with **influence** (subject matter experts, opinion leaders)
- Those **impacted** by changes (affected teams, communities)

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Power/Interest Grid

The most common stakeholder analysis tool:

<div class="mermaid">
quadrantChart
    title Stakeholder Power/Interest Grid
    x-axis Low Interest --> High Interest
    y-axis Low Power --> High Power
    quadrant-1 Manage Closely
    quadrant-2 Keep Satisfied
    quadrant-3 Monitor
    quadrant-4 Keep Informed
</div>

| Quadrant | Power | Interest | Strategy |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Manage Closely** | High | High | Regular engagement, involve in decisions |
| **Keep Satisfied** | High | Low | Inform on major milestones, don't overwhelm |
| **Keep Informed** | Low | High | Regular updates, address concerns |
| **Monitor** | Low | Low | Minimal effort, watch for changes |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Stakeholder Assessment Criteria

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Power** | Can they stop or significantly impact the project? |
| **Interest** | How much do they care about the outcome? |
| **Influence** | Can they sway others' opinions? |
| **Impact** | How much will they be affected? |
| **Attitude** | Are they supportive, neutral, or resistant? |
| **Expectations** | What do they want from this project? |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Influence/Impact Matrix

Alternative analysis focusing on influence and project impact:

| Quadrant | Influence | Impact | Approach |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Key Players** | High | High | Close partnership |
| **Influencers** | High | Low | Keep on side |
| **Affected** | Low | High | Keep informed, address concerns |
| **Spectators** | Low | Low | Minimal engagement |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Attitude Assessment

| Attitude | Description | Response |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Champion** | Actively supports, promotes | Leverage their influence |
| **Supporter** | Positive, willing to help | Maintain engagement |
| **Neutral** | No strong opinion | Provide information, build support |
| **Critic** | Has concerns | Understand and address issues |
| **Blocker** | Actively opposes | Direct engagement, escalation if needed |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Stakeholder Analysis Template

| Stakeholder | Role | Power | Interest | Attitude | Key Concerns | Strategy |
|-------------|------|-------|----------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Sarah Chen | Sponsor | High | High | Champion | ROI, timeline | Weekly updates |
| IT Director | Approver | High | Medium | Neutral | Resources, security | Monthly reviews |

## Stakeholder Engagement Planning

### Engagement Levels

| Level | Description | Activities |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Unaware** | Don't know about project | Awareness communications |
| **Resistant** | Aware but opposed | Address concerns, negotiate |
| **Neutral** | Aware, neither for nor against | Provide benefits information |
| **Supportive** | Aware and supportive | Maintain engagement |
| **Leading** | Actively championing | Leverage their influence |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Engagement Planning Process

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[Current<br/>State] --> B[Desired<br/>State]
    B --> C[Gap<br/>Analysis]
    C --> D[Actions<br/>to Move]
    D --> E[Monitor<br/>Progress]

    classDef blue fill:#108BB9,stroke:none,color:#fff
    class A,B,C,D,E blue
</div>

For each stakeholder:
1. **Current state** - Where are they now? (Unaware to Leading)
2. **Desired state** - Where do you need them to be?
3. **Gap** - What needs to change?
4. **Actions** - What will move them?
5. **Owner** - Who is responsible for this stakeholder?

### Engagement Strategies by Type

|------------------|---------------------|
| **High power, resistant** | One-on-one meetings, understand concerns, find common ground |
| **High power, supportive** | Keep them informed, leverage for sponsorship |
| **End users** | Involve in design, provide training, address concerns |
| **Technical experts** | Consult on solutions, respect expertise |
| **Regulators** | Formal communications, demonstrate compliance |
