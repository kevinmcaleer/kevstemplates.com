# Define Blueprint

The Blueprint defines the target state - what the organisation will look like after the project delivers its changes.

## What is a Blueprint?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> A Blueprint is a model of the future state describing the capabilities, processes, organisation, information, and technology needed to deliver the vision.
</div>

## Key Activities

1. **Document current state** - As-is architecture and processes
2. **Define target capabilities** - What the organisation needs to do
3. **Design future state** - Blueprint models and designs
4. **Analyse gaps** - Difference between current and target
5. **Define transition** - How to get from here to there

---

## Blueprint Principles

Good blueprints should be:
- Aligned to strategy and vision
- Achievable within constraints
- Clear and understandable
- Flexible enough to adapt
- Detailed enough to guide delivery
