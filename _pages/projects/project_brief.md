- Discussions with corporate management regarding corporate strategy and any policies and standards that apply
- Discussions with the Project Board and users if the project mandate is incomplete or if no project mandate is provided
- Discussions with the operations and maintenance organisation (if applicable)
- Discussions with the (potential) suppliers regarding specialist development lifecycles that could be used
- Lessons Log

A Project Brief can take a number of formats, including:
- Document or presentation slides
- Enter in a project management tool

- The project approach considers a range of solutions, such as: bespoke or off-the-shelf; contracted out or developed in-house; designed from new or a modified existing product
- The project approach h as been selected which maximizes the change of achieving overall success for the project
- The project objectives, project approach and strategies are consistent with the organisation's corporate social responsibility directive
