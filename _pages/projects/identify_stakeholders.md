# Identify Stakeholders

{:toc}
* toc

In the stage of a project where you "identify key stakeholders," the goal is to identify and understand the individuals, groups, or organizations that have an interest in or will be affected by the project. Key stakeholders are those who can influence the project's success or are directly impacted by its outcomes.

---

The process of identifying key stakeholders involves several steps:

## Stakeholder Identification

Identify potential stakeholders by considering various categories such as internal stakeholders (e.g., project team members, management, employees) and external stakeholders (e.g., clients, customers, suppliers, regulatory bodies, community groups).

---

## Stakeholder Analysis

Analyze each identified stakeholder to assess their level of interest, power, influence, and potential impact on the project. This analysis helps prioritize stakeholders and understand their perspectives, needs, expectations, and potential concerns.

---

## Stakeholder Mapping

Create a stakeholder map or matrix to visually represent the stakeholders and their attributes. This map helps identify relationships, dependencies, and communication channels between stakeholders.

---

## Engagement Strategy

Develop an engagement strategy to effectively involve and communicate with each stakeholder. Determine the frequency, methods, and channels of communication, as well as the level of involvement and participation required from each stakeholder.

---

## Communication Planning

Plan how to communicate project updates, progress, and key information to the identified stakeholders. Consider tailoring the communication style and content to suit each stakeholder's preferences and requirements.

---

## Stakeholder Engagement Plan

Develop a stakeholder engagement plan that outlines specific actions, responsibilities, and timelines for engaging with key stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. This plan helps ensure ongoing collaboration, support, and involvement.

---

## Relationship Building

Build and maintain positive relationships with stakeholders by actively listening to their concerns, addressing their needs, involving them in decision-making processes when appropriate, and seeking their feedback.

---

## Continuous Assessment

Regularly review and reassess the stakeholder landscape as the project progresses. New stakeholders may emerge, and the dynamics of existing stakeholders may change. Adapt the engagement strategy and communication plan accordingly.

# Summary

By identifying key stakeholders, project teams can gain a deeper understanding of the project's environment and potential impact. This knowledge helps inform decision-making, manage expectations, mitigate risks, build support, and facilitate successful project delivery. Effective stakeholder management throughout the project lifecycle contributes to stakeholder satisfaction, project success, and the realization of desired outcomes.
