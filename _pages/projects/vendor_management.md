# Vendor & Contract Management

Effective vendor and contract management ensures third parties deliver quality work on time and within budget, while managing risks and maintaining productive relationships.

---

## Why Vendor Management Matters

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Poor vendor management is a leading cause of project overruns. Projects with strong vendor governance are 3x more likely to deliver on time and budget.
</div>

Effective vendor management:
- Reduces delivery risk
- Controls costs
- Ensures quality
- Protects intellectual property
- Maintains compliance
- Builds strategic partnerships

## Procurement Process

### Make vs Buy Decision

Before engaging vendors, decide whether to build in-house or buy externally:

| Factor | Make (In-house) | Buy (Vendor) |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Core competency** | Build if strategic | Buy if commodity |
| **Capacity** | If team available | If no capacity |
| **Speed** | If faster internally | If vendor faster |
| **Cost** | If cheaper long-term | If cheaper short-term |
| **Risk** | Keep control | Transfer risk |
| **IP** | Retain ownership | Consider ownership |
