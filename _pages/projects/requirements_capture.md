# Requirements Capture

Requirements capture (elicitation) is the process of gathering requirements from stakeholders and other sources.

---

## Elicitation Techniques

| Technique | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Interviews** | One-on-one discussions | Detailed understanding, sensitive topics |
| **Workshops** | Group sessions | Consensus building, complex areas |
| **Observation** | Watching users work | Understanding actual behaviour |
| **Document analysis** | Reviewing existing materials | Background, existing processes |
| **Surveys** | Structured questionnaires | Large groups, quantitative data |
| **Prototyping** | Building models to explore | UI/UX requirements, validation |

## Workshop Facilitation

Effective requirements workshops need:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clear objectives** | What decisions/outputs are needed |
| **Right participants** | People with knowledge and authority |
| **Structured agenda** | Logical flow of activities |
| **Visual techniques** | Diagrams, models, sticky notes |
| **Skilled facilitation** | Keeping discussion on track |
| **Documented outputs** | Capture decisions and actions |

## Interview Best Practices

1. **Prepare** - Research the interviewee and topic
2. **Open questions** - Encourage detailed responses
3. **Listen actively** - Focus on understanding
4. **Probe** - Ask follow-up questions
5. **Confirm** - Verify understanding
6. **Document** - Capture key points promptly

## Common Challenges

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Stakeholders don't know what they want | Use prototypes, examples |
| Conflicting requirements | Facilitate prioritisation |
| Hidden assumptions | Ask probing questions |
| Scope creep | Maintain clear boundaries |
| Missing stakeholders | Stakeholder analysis upfront |
