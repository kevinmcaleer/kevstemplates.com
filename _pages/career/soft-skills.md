## Leadership

### Leading Without Authority

As a PM, you rarely have direct authority over your team. You lead through influence.

| Traditional Authority | PM Leadership |
|----------------------|---------------|
| "Do this because I'm your boss" | "Let's do this because it's right for the project" |
| Compliance through hierarchy | Commitment through buy-in |
| Tell people what to do | Help people understand why |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Building Influence

|-----------|-------------|
| **Expertise** | Be knowledgeable, share insights |
| **Relationships** | Build genuine connections |
| **Reciprocity** | Help others, they'll help you |
| **Consistency** | Be reliable and predictable |
| **Vision** | Connect work to meaningful outcomes |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Leadership Styles

| Style | When to Use | When to Avoid |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Directive** | Urgent situations, unclear tasks | Experienced teams, creative work |
