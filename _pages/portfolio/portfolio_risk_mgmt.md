## Portfolio Risk Management

Portfolio risk management takes a strategic view of risks across all programmes and projects in the portfolio. It focuses on:

- **Aggregated risks** - Combined view of risks across the portfolio
- **Dependencies** - Risks that span multiple projects
- **Resource conflicts** - Competition for shared resources
- **Strategic alignment** - Ensuring projects remain aligned with goals

### Risk Framework for Portfolios

A portfolio risk framework provides consistent processes across all initiatives:

- Standard risk assessment criteria
- Common scoring scales
- Escalation thresholds
- Reporting requirements

### Risk Awareness and training

- Ensure all project and programme managers understand the risk framework
- Provide training on risk assessment and response planning
- Share lessons learned across the portfolio

### Escalation

Define clear escalation paths for risks that:
- Exceed project tolerances
- Affect multiple projects
- Require portfolio-level decisions
- Impact strategic objectives
