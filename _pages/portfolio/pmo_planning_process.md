## Process Overview
Portfolio planning helps govern:
- the amount of work in-flight via [demand management](demand_management)
- the amount of work you plan to do through [portfolio management](portfolio_management)
- and amount of cost and benefits delivered through the portfolio

The process for planning is simple:
1. Create a draft plan
1. Identify resources required
1. Forecast costs
1. Identify interdependencies between programmes and projects, adjusting plans accordingly
1. Monitor delivery

### Roles and Responsibilities
There are only a handful of roles from a planning perspective:

#### Resource Planner
The Resource Planner manages the pool of specialist resources and releases them to projects via the engagement process. Project Managers must ask the resource manager for the resources that are required to deliver the project, and once secured, update the project plan to reflect their availability.

The Resource Manager also approves timesheets, annual leave and other personnel related activities.

#### Planner
The planner is responsible for creating, updating and managing project, programme and portfolio plans. A Planner may be dedicated to a single programme or project, or may spread their time across many engagements. The Planner reports to the PMO Resource Manager.
