# Support Model

The Support Model defines how the delivered solution will be supported in live operation, including team structures, processes, and service levels.

---

## Purpose

Planning the support model ensures:
- Smooth transition from project to operations
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Defined service levels
- Appropriate skills and resources
- Sustainable ongoing support

---

## Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Support tiers** | L1, L2, L3 support structure and escalation |
| **Service levels** | Response times, resolution targets, availability |
| **Team structure** | Roles, responsibilities, and sizing |
| **Processes** | Incident, problem, change management |
| **Tools** | Service desk, monitoring, knowledge base |
| **Knowledge transfer** | Training and documentation for support teams |
