## Lessons Learned

### Top Lessons

| # | Lesson | Recommendation |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Early QA involvement reduced defects significantly | Build QA into project from start |
| 2 | Third-party integration complexity was underestimated | Add contingency for external dependencies |
| 3 | Regular demos kept stakeholders engaged | Weekly demos for all future projects |
| 4 | Cross-training reduced key person risk | Mandate cross-training on all projects |
| 5 | Documentation started too late | Begin documentation in parallel with development |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### What Went Well

| Area | Success Factor |
|------|----------------|
| Team collaboration | Daily stand-ups, open communication |
| Stakeholder engagement | Regular demos, responsive to feedback |
| Quality | Early testing, automated checks |
| Risk management | Proactive identification and mitigation |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### What Could Be Improved

| Area | Improvement |
|------|-------------|
| Third-party coordination | Earlier engagement, more contingency |
| Documentation timing | Start earlier, parallel with development |
| UAT planning | Secure resources earlier |
| Training materials | Allow more preparation time |
