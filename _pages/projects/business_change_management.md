# Business Change Management

Business Change Management (BCM) focuses on the people side of change - helping individuals and teams transition from the current state to the future state.

## Why Change Management Matters

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Projects deliver outputs, but benefits are only realised when people change how they work. Without effective change management, even well-delivered projects fail to achieve their objectives.

## Change Impact Assessment

Assess the impact on affected groups:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Process** | How will ways of working change? |
| **Technology** | What new systems/tools are introduced? |
| **Organisation** | Are structures or roles changing? |
| **Skills** | What new capabilities are needed? |
| **Culture** | Does this challenge existing norms? |

## The Change Curve

People typically move through stages when experiencing change:

    A[Shock] --> B[Denial]
    B --> C[Frustration]
    C --> D[Depression]
    D --> E[Experiment]
    E --> F[Decision]
    F --> G[Integration]

Understanding where people are on this curve helps tailor support and communication.

## Building Change Readiness

### Organisational Readiness
- Leadership alignment and sponsorship
- Clear vision and case for change
- Capacity to absorb change
- History with previous changes

### Individual Readiness
- Awareness of the need to change
- Understanding of what's changing
- Belief in ability to change
- Motivation to make the change

---

## Communication Planning

Effective change communication answers:
- **Why** are we changing?
- **What** is changing?
- **When** will it happen?
- **How** will it affect me?
- **Where** can I get help?

### Communication Principles
- Start early and communicate often
- Use multiple channels
- Tailor messages to audiences
- Allow two-way dialogue
- Be honest about challenges

## Managing Resistance

| Type of Resistance | Response |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Lack of awareness** | Communicate the why |
| **Fear of unknown** | Provide information and support |
| **Loss of control** | Involve people in decisions |
| **Lack of skills** | Provide training and coaching |
| **Bad timing** | Acknowledge and address workload |
| **Past experience** | Learn from and reference history |

## Change Network

Build a network of change champions:
- Identify influential people in affected areas
- Engage them early in the process
- Equip them to support their peers
- Use them as feedback channels
- Recognise their contribution

---

## Measuring Change Success

| Measure | What It Tells You |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Awareness levels** | Do people know about the change? |
| **Training completion** | Are people equipped? |
| **Adoption rates** | Are people using the new way? |
| **Proficiency** | Are people using it correctly? |
| **Engagement scores** | How do people feel about it? |
| **Benefits realisation** | Are outcomes being achieved? |
