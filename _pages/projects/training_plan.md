## Training Delivery Methods

| Method | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **Classroom** | Complex topics, discussion | Interactive, questions | Scheduling, travel |
| **Virtual classroom** | Remote audiences | Flexible location | Less engagement |
| **E-learning** | Large audiences, basics | Self-paced, scalable | Less interactive |
| **On-the-job** | Practical skills | Real context | Impacts productivity |
| **Coaching** | Individual development | Personalised | Resource intensive |

## Training Schedule Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Go-live date** | Training must complete before |
| **Audience availability** | When can people attend? |
| **Trainer availability** | Who delivers when? |
| **Venue/platform** | Where will training occur? |
| **Dependencies** | System access, materials ready? |
| **Retention** | Not too early before go-live |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Timing Best Practice
- Complete training 1-2 weeks before go-live
- Too early = skills forgotten
- Too late = not ready for go-live

---

## Training Materials

| Material | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Presentations** | Instructor-led content |
| **User guides** | Reference documentation |
| **Quick reference cards** | Key tasks at a glance |
| **Job aids** | Step-by-step instructions |
| **Videos** | Demonstrations, walkthroughs |
| **Practice exercises** | Hands-on learning |
| **Assessments** | Verify understanding |

## Resource Requirements

| Resource | Considerations |
|----------|----------------|
| **Trainers** | Internal or external? |
| **Subject matter experts** | Content validation |
| **Training environment** | System access for practice |
| **Venues** | Rooms, equipment |
| **Materials** | Printing, distribution |
| **Budget** | Development and delivery costs |
