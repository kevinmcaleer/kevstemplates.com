# Stakeholder Register

The Stakeholder Register is a project document that captures information about all identified stakeholders, including their interests, level of influence, and planned engagement approach.

## What is a Stakeholder Register?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> A Stakeholder Register is a living document that records all individuals, groups, or organisations who may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by the project.

## Purpose

The Stakeholder Register helps to:
