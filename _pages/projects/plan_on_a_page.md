# Plan on a Page (POAP)

A Plan on a Page is a single-page summary that captures the essential elements of a project. It provides a quick, digestible overview for stakeholders who need to understand the project without reading detailed documentation.

---

## What is a Plan on a Page?

<div class="alert alert-info">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle mr-2"></i>
<strong>Definition:</strong> A Plan on a Page (POAP) is a concise, visual summary of a project's key information - objectives, timeline, milestones, risks, and status - presented on a single page for easy communication and reference.
</div>

A POAP is:
- **Concise** - Everything fits on one page
- **Visual** - Uses graphics, timelines, and colour
- **Accessible** - Understandable without prior context
- **Current** - Updated regularly to reflect status

---

## Why Use a Plan on a Page?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Executive communication** | Busy stakeholders can grasp the project quickly |
| **Alignment** | Ensures everyone has the same understanding |
| **Decision support** | Provides context for steering group decisions |
| **Onboarding** | Helps new team members understand the project |
| **Status reporting** | Quick visual update on progress |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## Who is it For?

The POAP serves different audiences:

| Audience | What They Need |
|----------|----------------|
| **Sponsors/Executives** | High-level progress, key decisions needed |
| **Steering Group** | Status, risks, milestones, issues |
| **Programme Managers** | Dependencies, resource needs, timeline |
| **New Team Members** | Project context and objectives |
| **External Stakeholders** | What the project is and when it delivers |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## What to Include

A good POAP typically contains these elements:

### Essential Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project Name** | Clear title and reference number |
| **Objectives** | What the project will achieve (2-3 bullet points) |
| **Scope** | What's included and excluded |
| **Timeline** | Visual representation of key phases |
| **Milestones** | Key dates and deliverables |
| **Status** | RAG (Red/Amber/Green) overall and by area |
| **Key Risks** | Top 3-5 risks with mitigation |
| **Budget** | High-level financials |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

### Optional Elements

| Element | When to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Benefits** | When business case is important |
| **Dependencies** | When external factors are critical |
| **Team/Governance** | For complex stakeholder environments |
| **Key Decisions** | When steering input is needed |
| **Next Steps** | For action-oriented updates |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

---

## Level of Detail

The POAP should be **high-level** - just enough detail to understand and make decisions.

### Right Level of Detail

| Too Little | Just Right | Too Much |
|------------|------------|----------|
| "Project on track" | "Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 starting next week" | Detailed task lists |
| "Some risks" | "3 high risks, 2 being actively mitigated" | Full risk register |
| "Within budget" | "£450k of £500k spent, forecast on target" | Line-by-line costs |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

**Rule of thumb**: If someone needs more detail, they should ask for it or refer to detailed documentation. The POAP opens the conversation, it doesn't replace detailed planning.

## How to Create a POAP

### Step-by-Step Process

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart LR
    A[Gather<br/>Information] --> B[Select<br/>Key Points]
    B --> C[Design<br/>Layout]
    C --> D[Add<br/>Visuals]
    D --> E[Review &<br/>Refine]
    E --> F[Share &<br/>Update]
</div>

### 1. Gather Information

Pull together:
- Project objectives and scope
- Current schedule and milestones
- Budget status
- Top risks and issues
- Recent achievements
- Upcoming activities

### 2. Select Key Points

Apply the "So what?" test:
- Does the executive need to know this?
- Will it affect decisions?
- Is it different from last time?

### 3. Design Layout

Choose a layout that:
- Fits on one page (A4 or Letter)
- Has clear sections
- Uses white space effectively
- Guides the eye logically

### 4. Add Visuals

Use visuals to convey information quickly:
- Timeline/Gantt for schedule
- RAG indicators for status
- Charts for budget
- Icons for quick recognition

### 5. Review & Refine

Check that:
- A newcomer could understand it
- Status is clearly visible
- Key messages stand out
- Nothing critical is missing

### 6. Share & Update

- Distribute before meetings
- Update regularly (weekly or fortnightly)
- Version control if needed

## POAP Layout Example

Here's a typical POAP structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROJECT NAME                                    Status: GREEN  │
│  Project Manager: [Name]           Last Updated: [Date]         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  OBJECTIVES                        │  KEY MILESTONES            │

│  • Objective 2                     │  ✓ Design - Feb            │
│  • Objective 3                     │  → Build - Mar (current)   │

│  Status: GREEN             │                                    │
├────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┤

│  • Security review passed          │  • UAT preparation         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## RAG Status Guidelines

Use consistent criteria for RAG ratings:

| Status | Meaning | Criteria |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Green** | On track | Within tolerance, no significant issues |
| **Amber** | At risk | Issues identified, mitigation in progress |
| **Red** | Off track | Tolerance breached, escalation required |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

Consider RAG for multiple dimensions:
- Overall status
- Schedule
- Budget
- Scope
- Resources
- Risks

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Too much detail | Readers lose key messages | Apply "So what?" test |
| Stale information | Misleading stakeholders | Update before each use |
| No RAG status | Unclear project health | Add clear status indicators |
| Missing timeline | No sense of progress | Include visual schedule |
| Jargon heavy | Excludes non-experts | Use plain language |
| Inconsistent format | Hard to compare over time | Use a template |
{:class="table table-single table-narrow"}

## Tips for Effective POAPs

### Do
- Update before every steering meeting
- Use colour consistently (RAG)
- Include "as of" date
- Highlight changes from last version
- Keep the same layout each time

### Don't
- Cram in every detail
- Use tiny fonts to fit more in
- Hide bad news
- Forget the audience
- Skip the visuals
